	<br>To help us introduce the site to as many neighborhoods in Seattle as possible, we're going to need your help.</p>
	  
	<p>If you would like to make a secure donation to support Flash Volunteer, a registered 501(c)3 nonprofit, please click the Donate button!</p>
	
	<p>In case you were wondering, here is what your generosity can help us accomplish:</p>
	<ul class="bullets">
	 <li>$25: Printed outreach materials to spread the word about what we are doing
	(and you get a Flash Volunteer sticker and lapel pin as a thank you)</li>
	 <li>$50: An entire outreach kit with stickers, postcards, banners and more
	(you get a Flash Volunteer sticker and lapel pin)  
	 <li>$100: Office supplies for an entire month
	(you get a snazzy Flash Volunteer t-shirt, sticker, and lapel pin)</li>     
	 <li>$250: One neighborhood outreach event (complete with Eva's extra special homemade Flash Lemonade!)
	(you get a Flash Volunteer t-shirt, sticker, lapel pin and a virtual hug, plus the secret lemonade recipe)</li>
	 <li>$500: One entire Version 2.0 feature (we'll send you a menu and you can pick which one you'd like to sponsor)
	(you get a Flash Volunteer t-shirt, sticker, lapel pin, real hug, karma, and the excitement of using a new feature)</li>
	 <li>$1000: Two new Version 2.0 features 
	(you get recognition as a Flash Volunteer Sustaining Donor plus even better karma and our love. And of course the t-shirt, lapel pin and sticker)</li>
	 <li>$2500: Three entire months(!) of website maintenance, "bug squashing" and general upkeep 
	(you get recognition as a Flash Volunteer Sustaining Donor plus even better karma and even more love, and the t-shirt, lapel pin and sticker)</li>
	 <li>$5000: If this were an IPO, you'd own the company. But since it's not, you'd keep us running for half a year!
	(you get top recognition as a Flash Volunteer Sustaining Donor plus everthing else.)</li>
	 </ul>
	 
	<p>Without your support, we'll have to trim our wicks and tighten our belts even further. 
	Which isn't really possible, so I guess you're going to have to make a donation to support 
	the future of community service in Seattle...and, eventually, the rest of the country (did I mention there 
	is already interest to start branches in Los Angeles and Philadelphia?).</p>
	 
	<br><p>Thanks so much!</p>
	<br>
	<p>p.s. Flash Volunteer is a registered 501(c)(3). All donations are tax-deductible.</p>
