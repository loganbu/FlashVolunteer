#Flash Volunteer
###Everyone Engaged in Volunteer Service.

Flash Volunteer seeks to build community and increase volunteerism through the creation of a sustainable, user-friendly online platform to connect, inspire and mobilize volunteers to effect meaningful change on a neighborhood level.
We are a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization and the code we are developing is open source. This project is based on Ruby on Rails and is deployed using the heroku platform.
